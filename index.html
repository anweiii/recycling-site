        <h1><a href="sustainability.html">Bee's Wrap</a></h1>
        <p>
					Plastic wrap is great for covering and storing food, but <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/story-of-plastic-sticky-problem-of-plastic-wrap">not so great for the environment</a>. It can be more costly to recycle plastic wrap than using natural materials. If plastic wrap isn't recycled, it could end up in the landfill and are not biodegradable and will remain intact for years. Alternatively, when PVC and PVDC is incinerated, it can release dioxin which is a highly toxic chemical. Opting for a reusable "plastic wrap" such as Bee's Wrap is more eco-friendly. They're made of organic cotton and beeswax therefore are also washable, compostable, and reusable. They're also only sourced from sustainable-managed hives. This business is great because they also boast that their packaging is completely recyclable and fully biodegradable. To use, wrap the Bee's Wrap around the targeted item and use your hands' warmth to seal. To reuse, wash in cool water and mild soap, then air dry before reusing again. As an added bonus, they also have antibacterial properties to keep food fresh.
