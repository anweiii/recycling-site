  <h1 class="pageTitle">Activism and Advocacy</h1>

  <p class="leftAlignP"> One very important step in environmentalism is activism and advocacy. This page provides a general outline of ways our users can engage in advocacy, which is further broken up into global, commercial, and local-scale efforts. The local action page also includes the option for users to submit their own posts to talk about tips, their own advocacy, or otherwise contribute to the site. </p>

    <p> Global agreements are key to defeating climate change; international climate activism has gained lots of traction.

      A closed loop economic model is one approach to this that is currently being implemented in many European countries; its aim is similar to the zero-waste in that the product lifecycle is designed to be ongoing past an initial period of reuse, and repairability is accesssible and prefferable over replacement.
