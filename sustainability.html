				    <br>
            <p>
					    Since containers and packaging is the largest category of plastic waste, consider using a reusable soap dispenser option. We suggest Gelo Foam Soap. They have affordable soap pod refills that are biodegradable. You can buy your own reusable foam soap dispenser such as a glass bottle or order one from Gelo. Simply fill the bottle with water, drop in the soap pod, and give it a good swirl so that the pod dissolves. Now you have a new bottle of soap with minimum packaging.

				    <br>
            <p>
					    Plastic wrap is great for covering and storing food, but <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/story-of-plastic-sticky-problem-of-plastic-wrap">not so great for the environment</a>. It can be more costly to recycle plastic wrap than using natural materials. If plastic wrap isn't recycled, it could end up in the landfill and are not biodegradable and will remain intact for years. Alternatively, when PVC and PVDC is incinerated, it can release dioxin which is a highly toxic chemical. Opting for a reusable "plastic wrap" such as Bee's Wrap is more eco-friendly. They're made of organic cotton and beeswax therefore are also washable, compostable, and reusable. They're also only sourced from sustainable-managed hives. This business is great because they also boast that their packaging is completely recyclable and fully biodegradable. To use, wrap the Bee's Wrap around the targeted item and use your hands' warmth to seal. To reuse, wash in cool water and mild soap, then air dry before reusing again. As an added bonus, they also have antibacterial properties to keep food fresh.

				    <br>
            <p>
					    Toothpaste is typically individually packaged in a #4 plastic and aluminum encasing. This mixed package composition is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49280709 ">difficult to recycle</a> because recycling facilities can't separate the materials. Instead of buying toothpaste tubes, opt for toothpaste tablets. Kalyan offers all natural toothpaste tablets packaged in a tin container. This portable alternative is also great for camping and is even airport and TSA safe.

				    <br>
            <p>
					    Deodorant is primarily made of plastic. Check with the manufacturer to see if it's recyclable. Sometimes only parts of the deodorant are recyclable. For instance, the body of the deodorant might be a different plastic from the wheel of the deodorant. Switch to a refillable deodorant such as Dove. The case is stainless steel, therefore making the case very durable. They have stick refills available and are sold in 98% recycled polypropylene plastic and are recyclable themselves. They also offer a lifetime warranty on their stainless steel cases.
