  <h1 class="pageTitle">Commercial + Industrial Change</h1>
  <div class="alignment">
    <p>Perhaps the most essential change needed to make the necessary strides in recycling and sustainability practices as a nation is in the industrial and commercial sector. Without change in the industrial/commercial/military industry, individual/family changes are almost meaningless. We need to shift our thinking and approach to sustainability to reflect this! Pressure is being put on businesses and corporations to think aboust material sustainability and recyclability by countless activist and movements, and real change is slowly but surely emerging. Here we discuss some approaches, successes, and important facts for industrial recycling and sustainability advocacy.</p>

      <br>
      A closed loop economic model is one approach to this that is currently being implemented in many European countries; its aim is similar to the zero-waste in that the product lifecycle is designed to be ongoing past an initial period of reuse, and repairability is accesssible and prefferable over replacement. Because of the difficulty of swiching over from a "single-use" economy, government incentives combined with consumer pressure are necessary to begin a shift in this direction for the U.S.
