      <p>
        A cooperative international approach to sustainability and recycling is absolutely necessary to prevent loopholes or moving targets in the movement for a green Earth. Strong multilateral policy, implementable local program models, and measures for enforcement all fall into this category. Here, we outline important political change that is happening as a result of envrionmental protection lobbying and activism, and what lessons we can learn from countries outside of our own.

      <h2>Multilateral Policies</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><h3>The Paris Agreement and the Green New Deal Proposal</h3>
          <ul><li style="list-style:none;"> The Paris Accord, initially ratified in 2016, is a multilateral agreement by a multitude of UN nations to limit GHG emissions and drastically change the climate change trajectory by setting individualized goals and hard carbon limits for the countries invovled. The Green New Deal aims to achieve a “fair and just transition” to net-zero emissions and ties climate action to other goals such as universal health care and a jobs guarantee remains in the proposal stage as of 2021. </li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><h3>EU WEEE Directive and the UN Sustaiable Development Goal</h3>
        <ul><li style="list-style:none;">EU rules on WEEE aim to contribute to sustainable production and consumption. They address environmental and other issues caused by the growing number of discarded electronics in the EU. The UN Sustaiable Development Goals, while not a hard policy, provides a framework of specific goals achievable by 2030 as well as detailing actions taken and encouraging all UN countries to take part. This framework provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. </li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><h3>The Montreal Protocol</h3>
        <ul><li style="list-style:none;">The Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer s a model of cooperation. It is a product of the recognition and international consensus that ozone depletion is a global problem, both in terms of its causes and its effects. Finalized in 1987, is a global agreement to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by phasing out the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances (ODS).</li></ul>
